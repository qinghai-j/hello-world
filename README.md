# hello-world
the first repository

Hi the world!
Jason here.
This is the first time to run a new Github project.
A starting, hope never ends if I can find lots of funs here.
Good luck!

PS:
It says Githun is a good tool for version control. I think it might can be used to manage documentation version as well.
